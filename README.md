# Mega-Matcher!

## Description

I wanted a little challenge to test my skill in manipulating the DOM. So I did what any other new dev does these days and I asked AI what i should do to practice this skill. It suggested i make a matching game and here we are. Mega Matcher! A classic matching game that gets bigger each time you play.

## Usage

To play click the cards and try to make pairs. When youve matched all the cards if you want to play a new game with even more matches to make click the "New game?" button on the bottom of the page. To reset just refresh the page. Have fun matching!
